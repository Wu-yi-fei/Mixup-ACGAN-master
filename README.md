"Controllable Photovoltaic Scenario Generation via Mixup-based Deep Generative Networks"

## Synopsis
Scenario generation is an essential method to offer a series of possible power scenarios in the future for power system planning. This paper proposes a noval method for photovoltaic (PV) scenario generation by employing interpretable condition in controllable generative adversarial networks (GAN). In order to improve the generalization performance of the network and enhance the linear expression between training samples, a data augmentation strategy is introduced to the network. The numerical results demonstrate that, the proposed model can achieve the controllable generation of scenarios covering mutiple statistical characteristics and create brand new patterns that are different from existing scenarios.
