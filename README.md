This repository contains the source code that implements the network described in the paper:

"Controllable Photovoltaic Scenario Generation via Mixup-based Deep Generative Networks"

## Synopsis
Scenario generation is an essential method to offer a series of possible power scenarios in the future for power system planning. This paper proposes a noval method for photovoltaic (PV) scenario generation by employing interpretable condition in controllable generative adversarial networks (GAN). In order to improve the generalization performance of the network and enhance the linear expression between training samples, a data augmentation strategy is further introduced to the network.
